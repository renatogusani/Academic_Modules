1. range of functions must include: 8n, log n, 2n2,n3, 2n. In addition to these 5 functions the program should also include two extra functions of
my choosing.

2. a simnple binary search question asked to be done in word

3. program that stores a graph with at least 6 vertices. The graph is initially empty – it
has no edges. An end user will be required to build up a route
network between the vertexes via user input.

4. A popular genre of text-based games relies on decision trees. Players are given a text
scenario to which they have to reply yes or no. If they answer “Yes” they will be provided with
one scenario. If “No” a different scenario. Each of these scenarios will then require another
yes/no answer.

  Develop your own scenarios and create a decision tree game. Provide the entire Python code to
  be included in an application that creates a Binary Tree Structure for the game. Users can supply
  their yes or no answers either by console input or from a GUI.

  The Binary tree must have a height of at least 4. One approach would be to represent the Nodes
  by a class of which each node is an instance. Some leaf nodes must require the player to be
  moved back up the tree by at least 2 levels.
